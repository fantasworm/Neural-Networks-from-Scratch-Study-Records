0. Set all weights to 1, bias to 0 for all layers
For each pair of hidden layer neurons(except the bottom pair, offsetting only):
1. Set all weights to 1, bias to 0
2. Set the weight(slope) for the 1st neuron
3. Set the bias(offset, + value) for the 2nd neuron
4. Set the weight(slope, -1) for the 2nd neuron (causing a deactivation point to occur)
5. Set the weight(slope, -1) for the output neuron
6. Set the bias(offset) for the 2nd neuron of the bottom pair
7. Work on the next pair and repeat
